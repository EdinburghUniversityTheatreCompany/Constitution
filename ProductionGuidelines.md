EUTC Production Guidelines
==========================


## Proposing The Show

The EUTC is proud to have a number of slots for our company members to propose for. To propose a show, you NEED A DIRECTOR, A PRODUCER, A STAGE MANAGER, and A TECH MANAGER. These roles need to be filled for our insurance and our risk assessments; failure to have a complete team by the deadline will result in your proposal being marked late which will give you the last preference at the GM. Failure to have a complete team by the GM means your proposal will be void.

To propose with rights, you will need to know if the rights are available and how much they will be per performance. As a committee, we strongly encourage  that you try to get a proforma/prospective license drawn up by the proposal deadline as if successful, the invoice will need to be processed and paid as soon as possible - without rights, you aren’t legally allowed to start rehearsals! Be aware that with original writing, rights are unnecessary. 

The show’s budget should also be passed by the business manager - be prepared to justify your expenses to both them and the company at the GM. In the case of mainterms and lunchtimes, it is recommended that you should get your budget passed by the Business Manager as it will prevent the possibility of future financial issues. Annual Events and Extraordinaries must, as per the Standing Orders B 3.3 and 3.4 respectively, have their budget approved by the Business Manager. If this is not done by the proposal deadline, it may be marked as late. 

Before the GM, you will need to fill out a written proposal found on the members’ section of the website. This should include a section about each section of your production with enough information for it to be voted on. If your proposal (i) does not have enough information, (ii) would break the law, or (iii) damage the theatre in the short or long term it may not reach the GM. This proposal is due the week before the GM (usually the Wednesday) at 9pm. If it is not submitted by the deadline, it will be marked late which will automatically give you the last preference at the GM. If at any point, you have any questions take a look at past proposals (found under the proposals sections of the website) or contact the Productions Manager! 

For the proposal of an Extraordinary, as per the Standing Orders B 3.4, the proposal must be submitted to the committee no later than the Committee Meeting prior to the proposal submission deadline (i.e. two meetings prior to the GM). The written proposal must be submitted prior to the written proposal submission deadline or else it will be marked as Late. Any proposal of an Extraordinary that clashes with another EUTC show, or event, is declared void; including allocated show slots. The production team of the affected show or event may choose to waive this right, in order to allow the Extraordinary to take place. In order to avoid this, contact the prod team that would be affected by the Extraordinary prior to submitting the proposal to the Committee.

If your proposal passes committee then at the corresponding GM, the team will be asked to get on stage and explain your proposal to the company. You should meet beforehand to discuss what will be said. You and your team will have 3 minutes to speak about your proposed show and ideas before answering the company’s questions. 


## Types of proposal and Relevant Budgets

Listed and described below are the slots available to propose for as members of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company. None of these have to take place in the building and we encourage production teams to both think out of the Bedlam box but also take advantage of the space we have. 

Each show gets a get in starting on the Saturday or Sunday, the day and time dependent on the slot you have and each is allowed to apply for an extended get in with appropriate justification. 

Lunchtime get ins start at 8pm on Sunday with the extended get in starting from 9am on the same day. There will be a break from 12-2 for maintenance as well as 6-8 for Imps rehearsal if it happens that week. We then recommend that your tech happens on Monday night with the dress run on Tuesday though ultimately please schedule these in a way that fits best for your production.

Mainterm get ins start at 2pm on Saturday with the extended get in starting after Imps on Friday. There will be a break on Saturday 12-2 for the Imps Workshop and then breaks on Sunday from 12-2 for Maintenance as well as 6-8 for Imps rehearsal if it happens that week. We recommend that you have your tech run on Sunday night with the dress run on Monday though ultimately choose what works best for your production

### Lunchtime
* 1 performance on a Wednesday at lunchtime (a second performance can be requested)
* Maximum amount of funding from the EUTC:
   * A show with rights:  £125
   * A show without rights: £65

A Lunchtime is an opportunity to put on a dramatically interesting show using limited resources. This means there is a smaller financial risk, making it a good slot for a show team’s first show, or for teams who wish to produce a show that is more experimental, or wish to challenge themselves by limiting resources. It is in no way limited to members new to the EUTC or is it a smaller show. This is a very good slot for new teams and directors or productions with more experimental elements. 

The one performance is traditionally performed at lunchtime on a Wednesday but it can be requested that the time is changed to an evening show on the Wednesday evening at a committee meeting. You can also request a second performance at that same committee meeting - it must take place following the Wednesday performance. If you are looking to have two performances, please make sure that you plan this when obtaining the rights for the show as if you wait until after the GM and after the committee meeting the second performance might not even be possible let alone legal! In order for the second performance to be granted the following criteria must be met:
1. the team should have raised or have a clear plan to raise the money to pay for the rights for the additional performance (if requiring rights) 
1. the committee should be confident that the show should sell at least 90 tickets between the two shows. You can make these changes up to three weeks before your first performance but we highly encourage that this happens at a committee meeting following the GM.   

### Mainterm

* No fewer than 3 performances
* Maximum Funding from the EUTC:
   * Shows requiring rights: £1050
   * Shows without rights: £850

A Mainterm is a slot with a larger budget and a longer run - you will have access to more resources making it great for experienced teams who will make use of more time and resources. With 3+  performances, a mainterm has a chance to become a more polished show with more performance time. 

### Annual Event

* The current annual events are the following:
   * Freshers’ Week/Welcome Week
   * Freshers’ Play
   * Freshers’ Slots
   * Panto
   * Bedlam Festival (Bedfest)

As per standing orders 3.3, our annual events take place roughly in the same place each year with the Productions Manager and President deciding at which GMs they are proposed with the dates being clarified in each year’s production schedule. For these events, the budget MUST BE PASSED BY THE BUSINESS MANAGER. 

Our annual events are split into two categories - shows (Freshers’ Play, Freshers’ Slots and Panto) and then other events (Bedfest and Freshers’ Week/Welcome Week). 

As with any other EUTC production, annual shows must have a Director, a Producer, a Stage Manager and a Tech Manager.

Our Annual Events also include two festivals, Bedfest and Freshers’/Welcome Week. When you propose as admin(s), you are proposing to form a festival team. As such, many of the Committee’s roles and responsibilities are designated to the Subcommittee for those two weeks. For both the week before and the week of the festival, the Festival team/subcommittee holds the responsibility and authority to run the Festival, including the use of its own schedule, socials, marketing, prices, show and workshop proposal system and selection process. 
The Festival Project Team is required to attend company meetings every Monday and they are responsible for attending the same quota of Committee meetings as the Projects subcommittee, at least once every 3 weeks for the duration of the festival, from the GM where it is approved until the week after the festival. 

At the time of the deadline, only the administrators are necessary on the proposal but a full team will need to be found including a Tech Manager, a Theatre Manager, a Marketing Manager, a  Box Office Manager and  a Cafe Manager. Depending on the parameters of the festival in question, a Cafe Manager might not be necessary. Once found, they subsequently are ratified at any meeting of the company. 

If you’re interested in proposing for any of these events outlined above, contact the Productions Manager who will be able to tell you more. 

### Extraordinary

An extraordinary is a production or event that could not reasonably meet the criteria for a Lunchtime, Mainterm, Annual Event or Festival. It is a slot that hopes to expand and diversify what we can do in our termtime production schedule. This event can take place inside or outside of Bedlam but if it is to take place outside of Bedlam than no rehearsal space can be booked inside of Bedlam. There is no limit to how many Extraordinaries can happen within a semester and as such this will not be taken into consideration when assessing these proposals. Extraordinaries can be proposed at whatever GM; they are not tied to only being proposed for scheduled GMs.  As such, Extraordinary Proposals will always be open on the website, but make sure that you talk to the Productions Manager! Also EGMs can be called at any time with at least 14 days notice to the company. 

For the proposal of an Extraordinary, as per the Standing Orders B 3.4, the proposal must be submitted to the committee no later than the Committee Meeting prior to the proposal submission deadline (i.e. two meetings prior to the GM). The written proposal must be submitted prior to the written proposal submission deadline or else it will be marked as Late. Any proposal of an Extraordinary that clashes with another EUTC show, or event, is declared void; including allocated show slots (which is the entire week). The production team of the affected show or event may choose to waive this right, in order to allow the Extraordinary to take place. In order to avoid this, contact the prod team that would be affected by the Extraordinary prior to submitting the proposal to the Committee.

There is no standing budget for extraordinaries but they must make back the entire budget given by the EUTC through ticket sales and fundraising. Budgets must be passed by the Business Manager,  prior to approaching committee to notify of coming up with the idea of the Extraordinary.

    
## Business, Fundraising, and Budget Advice
* Keep track of the rights.
* The budget for your show should cover all costs, from lighting hire, costumes, rights, publicity, set design, plus 10% contingency (for emergencies). You must stick to the budget. All budgets should be passed by the Business Manager before proposing.
* Any budget increases or changes must be proposed at a Committee Meeting, and with consultation of the Business Manager. No one wants to have to retroactively fundraise.
* Each production will be required to submit a deposit check. The Business Manager will tell you how much it is. Deposit checks can be in the form of a check, or an envelope containing the correct cash. The check may be cashed for:
    * Missing rehearsal space with less than 24hr notice. Inform the secretary if you think this is going to happen.
    * Breaking things. Broken property of the Company may be replaced with money from the deposit.
    * Rehearsal space left in a mess. This includes the kitchen area when rehearsing in Bedlam. Clean up after yourselves.
    * Incomplete get-in or get-out. Put everything away and tidy up after your performance.
    * Missing training. All members of the production team must attend DM training.
* Invoices for any expense should be placed in Business Manager’s pigeonhole. This is the same for any receipts for reimbursements – remember to include name and bank details for each receipt. Make sure the Business Manager knows what needs to be payed urgently (such as rights), as well as keeping them up to date on your expenditure.
* Fundraisers can be proposed at any meeting of the Committee, every Thursday at 18:30. You
should give Committee as much notice as possible. Committee can reject a fundraiser if it
clashes with another EUTC event, or if there is insufficient evidence to vote on it. To propose a
fundraiser you should explain the following:
    * What you are intending to do.
    * How and where you are intending to do it.
    * A time and a date.
    * How much you are intending to fundraise.
* **All fundraised cash should be banked with the Business Manager.** You cannot spend any of
the fundraised money without it first being checked with the Business Manager.
* Anything you purchase with your show budget **is the property of the Company.**
* Keep a careful note of your budget. Remind all crew that they are not to spend ANY MONEY
without the producer’s say-so and that they MUST give you a receipt if they want to be
reimbursed.
* Any tech hires must be approved by the Technical Manager.
* If you have any problems, or questions for clarification there is a Business resources section on
the Bedlam website. If this does not answer your question then please talk to the Business
Manager.

## Rights

* If your piece is original writing by a member of the company then you will not need to pay for rights!
    * As a side note all original writing should be sent to the Bedlam Librarian: library@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
* Published versions of the play should include details of who to contact. Get rights ASAP. It sometimes takes a while for them to come through. You will need to inform them of the length of your run. Some playwrights will not allow any changes to the script, others may allow a certain amount; check this to avoid hassle later.
    * Rights are LEGALLY needed for rehearsals to begin which is why you should organise aprospective license/license invoice before the GM so you can send this to Business Manager for quick payment.
    * Allow 2 weeks in your schedule for rights to be paid so get them submitted ASAP after the GM
* To avoid paying too much, stress that it is an amateur production, by a non-profit making theatre company, in a student theatre with a capacity under 100.
* Check that the playwright is VAT registered as we can claim VAT back.
* You can ask actors to buy their own copy of the script. If you are going to photocopy them you should do it yourself and collect money from each cast member to pay for it. Scripts are not included in the show budget for copyright reasons.

## Auditions and Casting

* Typically auditions are the weekend after the GM between 2pm and 6pm, although they may be rearranged for scheduling issues. The Productions Manager will inform you of when and where they are. You will be asked beforehand which room in the building you would like for your auditions. Arrive at least fifteen minutes before the advertised audition times to get set up. 
* You will need to print and bring your own audition pieces (have at least 50 pieces photocopied) and a show blurb (plot description, performance date, character descriptions) to pin on the wall.
* Usually there will be two days of auditions and another day for call backs. Any actors recalled for more than one show fill out a preference form to make casting conflicts resolve easier. 
* A casting meeting between all shows will happen an hour or so after the call backs. This meeting will be chaired by the Produ
ctions Manager. Have your cast list ready with second and third choices just in case. Shows often share actors if they are willing to be in more than one. 

## Rehearsals

* You will have rehearsals in Bedlam and in Pleasance. The Secretary will book you three rehearsals a week. If you wish to rehearse more you can contact them at **secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk**
* Tell the Secretary your preferred rehearsal times and provide them with a full cast and crew list soon after you cast. Let them know if you need specific kinds of rehearsal rooms, e.g., if you intend to tap dance during rehearsals.
* You can book rehearsal space through the Bedlam Schedule website (schedule.bedlamtheatre.co.uk). You should use the same sign in as for the members section.
* Inform the Secretary as far in advance as possible if you need to cancel a rehearsal. Rooms in Pleasance have to be used if booked otherwise Pleasance may withhold rooms from us. If arranged in advance another team may be able to use the space, if you cannot swap a member of your production team will have to baby-sit the space.
* Rehearsals cannot take place in Bedlam until your production team has undergone Duty Manager training, and know how to lock up the building.
* You can also book extra rehearsal space in university buildings via MyEd. Contact the Secretary if you don’t know how to do this.

## Press and Publicity ##

* You need to make posters. Programmes are optional and can be a pricey addition to the budget. Flyers can be very effective — you can leave them in bars, cafes and other venues, or get people to hand them out for you.
* You can make these look however you want. However do not miss out the following:
   * Show name, time, venue (typically Bedlam), date, year, and price.
   * Bedlam logo –it must be clear Bedlam is the venue, the easiest way to do this is to use the Bedlam Theatre logo.
   * Spell check.
   * We recommend you include the words Edinburgh University Theatre Company on your poster.
   * Obey copyright law. If in  doubt, speak to the Marketing Manager
   * Any stipulations by the rights issuer supersede these recommendations. Check their specifications.
* A3 is a good size for posters, and the university won't allow anything larger, though experiment as you want since non-standard sizes can look more striking. Get the cast and crew to help you distribute them. Don't put your posters over other Bedlam posters (unless that show has finished). 
   * If you are putting them up in university buildings you will need the EUSA stamp. This can be obtained in the Potterrow Societies office.
* Put some posters up around Bedlam. It's a good idea to have some posters or flyers up in the building for the Lunchtimes/Mainterms a couple of weeks before your show goes up, even if it's not quite the finished article. Printing takes time depending on how much you pay. Teviot Print Shop is quick but slightly pricey, and there are cheap companies online you can use but remember to do it far enough in advance that they arrive in time – you want to be putting publicity up by at least the week before your show. 
* Generally, VAT is not paid on flyers, but it is on posters so check to see whether it has been included in any quotes. 
* Flyering is a good way to sell the show. You can't flyer in university buildings, but you can flyer outside them. Outside the library at lunchtime can be effective. You can exit flyer other shows at Bedlam, provided you get permission from the production team of said show.
* If you don't feel at all artistic, or are a bit stuck with ideas or technical know-how, then there are plenty of people who can help with posters. The Marketing Manager will be able to help or suggest people to ask.
* The Marketing Manager will ask to see your posters before they're printed to check that all Bedlam publicity is of a high standard. Logos are available on the Bedlam website, from the Productions Manager or from the Marketing Manager.
* Getting the press in for interviews, previews, or reviews will help sell the show. Get information out early, typically at least two weeks before the show. Keep reminding press about the show.
* Your show will be made public on the Bedlam website as soon as your publicity is finished. The faster you do this the longer you have to sell tickets. Some shows build their own website for extra advertising. If you need any help with this, or have questions about getting more information up on the website, contact the IT Subcommittee
* **Show Blurbs:**
   * These should be given to the Secretary for inclusion in the Company email (get it to them by Friday 10pm). If nothing new is received, then they will use the blurb from your show proposal form or make something up at their discretion.
   * Try to pick an exciting angle to sell the show.
* **Programmes:**
   * Try not to leave these till the last minute so you have time to proof read them. The Marketing Manager may also want to see them before they are printed. Don't forget to thank people who helped with the show.
   
## Questionnaires and Get-in
   
* You will need to complete the following at least ten days your get-in starts. They are found at the bottom of your show page on the Bedlam members’ website. You will not be able to begin your get-in until they are all completed:
   * Tech Questionnaire
   * Producer Questionnaire
   * Stage Questionnaire
* Every show is allotted get-in space to start rigging lights and constructing the set the day before the tech run. This means 8pm on the Sunday before a lunchtime and 2pm on the Saturday before a Mainterm. The tech run then usually begins at 6pm the night after the get-in starts, which is also two days before the show goes up. The dress run takes place the night before the performance, also usually at 6pm.
* Any show can request extra get-in time by checking with the previous week’s show and coming to committee as soon as possible after getting passed, with three committee meetings prior to the performance being the absolute deadline. Speak to the Set and Tech Managers if you’re unsure about how much time you will need for your get-in.

## Get-Out and Maintenance

* This should happen immediately after the last performance. Make sure all your cast and crew stay around to help and it will all be over much more quickly. Even if they have no idea about tech or set the cast can still make themselves useful carrying stuff and tidying up. If you have arranged a sponsorship deal with a venue for an after-show party, make sure everyone goes along.
* If insufficient members of the cast and crew attend, or the theatre or any area of the building are left in an unacceptable condition then money may be taken from the deposit cheque. 
* The Sunday after your get-out all cast and crew must attend maintenance at 12:30. If you cannot attend maintenance, contact the Theatre Manager. They will make alternate arrangements to make up for this.

## Debriefing

* You must attend the Monday Company Meeting after the last performance of your show to report to the company. This is your chance to talk about what worked or didn’t and for you and Committee members to raise and discuss any problems.

---

# Other Important Notes 

## Costume and Props

* You can use any costumes or props from the Bedlam stores. However, all costumes must be washed/dry cleaned before returning them. If they get damaged, let the Wardrobe Manager know. Please do not remove the tags and labels from costumes. Keep the costume and props areas tidy and don't take anything out of the building without asking the Wardrobe Manager. 
* If you need any unusual costumes or props try asking in a Monday Company Meetingor posting in the Facebook group. People have some strange things. If you need any costumes made, the Wardrobe Manager will be able to help or suggest people who can.
* Try and locate things as early as possible, don’t leave it until the dress run!

## Being in the Building

* **Whenever you are rehearsing in Bedlam you must have a Duty Manager trained individual present. This is compulsory.** Since your production team must get DM trained, this is not difficult to arrange.
* Access:
   * If you are the first in the building you should arrange for a committee member to let you in with at least 24 hours of notice. If you have a problem getting in, contact a Committee member. 
   * Don’t leave the building until you’ve let in at least one person from the next show due to rehearse, unless there are people in the building who will remain there for a while. If you are the last person out make sure the fire exits are locked and the door is double locked.
   * The Stage Manager is entitled to a set of keys in the run up to production week and the show. In order to procure a set, speak to the Theatre Manager. Give them to the producer/director/tech manager at your discretion; just make sure you get them back and hand them in to the Theatre Manager after the run. If you are unsure about any of this, speak to the Theatre Manager. 
* Lights:
   * The switches are in the box to your right as you enter from the side door. The switch labelled ‘Bertha’ will turn on the auditorium lights. Rigged lights are to be used only for dress/tech runs, and shows themselves because they use monumental amounts of electricity
* Smoking:
   * Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the building, by law.
* Tidiness
   * Put your rubbish in the bin, and empty them if they’re full. We share this space as a Company so love it, and look after it. If you leave the place in a mess, the Theatre Manager will get mad and the FOH Manager can get a cleaner in and charge it on your budget.
   
## Health, Saftey and Welfare

* Put your rubbish in the bin, and empty them if they’re full. We share this space as a Company so love it, and look after it. If you leave the place in a mess, the Theatre Manager will get mad and the FOH Manager can get a cleaner in and charge it on your budget.
* If your show involves any stunts, stage combat or other things likely to result in injuries, make sure you notify the Theatre Manager in advance of rehearsals.
* Record any accidents in the accident book and to the Theatre Manager. This is behind the Box Office desk.
* There is a First Aid kit behind the box office, backstage, upstairs in the workshop, in the tech box, and in the kitchen.
* Remain vigilant in regard to the welfare of your cast and crew. 
   * You are required to have two welfare officers agreed upon by the cast and crew. Traditionally the director is one. Each welfare officer should have enough distance from the other, personally, that any cast and crew members should feel comfortable speaking to them about any matter arising with them. 
   * The Productions Manager will make a note of the welfare officers’ names and advise them of some of their roles and who the senior welfare officers are, i.e., the two Committee welfare officers, in case there are any issues that can’t be resolved within the team itself.
   * Refer to the Welfare Agreement on the website, and if any member of your cast or crew has any welfare concerns in regards to how the production or company is being run, they can talk to the Welfare Officer or President.
* **Lifting, building, and carrying:**
   * Only people who have been shown how to do tasks should attempt them. This is especially true of anything potentially dangerous, e.g., use of power tools, rigging, building flats, etc.. If you are unsure of anything, speak to the Theatre, Set, or Technical Manager.
   
## Administration and Organisation

* Photocopying – keep receipts from any photocopying you do, or screenshots if done on MyEd.
* Website – Go to www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk for copies of these guidelines, the constitution, the standing orders, and minutes. Contact the IT subcommittee with any questions about the website.
* Arrange and chair regular production meetings with your team. Check that everything is running smoothly in their different areas, try to sort out any problems that might have arisen and decide deadlines for the various jobs that need doing. Make sure everyone is up to date on the financial situation. Discuss the budget and fundraising/sponsorship. This is a good time for them to ask to spend money or give you receipts.
* Make sure that if anything goes wrong, you are the first person to be called. If this problem is to do with the building, damage etc. then phone the Theatre Manager. If it's a budget issue, phone the Business Manager. If it's a show issue, or you aren't sure, phone the Productions Manager. Keep the committee informed —we can help!

## Staffing

* Staffing slots for each production will be assigned by the Front of House Manager (FOH).
* All members of a production must staff. This includes Director(s), Tech Manager(s), Stage Manager(s), Producer(s), tech operators,and the cast. This is not limited to those listed on the proposal form.
* There are five staffing slots that need to be filled by each production; Duty Manager, Box Office, Indoor Hall Keeper, Outdoor Hall Keeper and Café. The responsibilities of each position are detailed within the Staffing Guidelines.
* Sign up can be done online through the Bedlam website: http://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/admin/staffings
* Staffers must be in Bedlam an hour and a half before the performance. This is 1pm for Lunchtimes or Mainterm matinee performances, 6pm for Mainterms or evening Lunchtime performances and 9pm for the Improverts.
* All members of the production team (Producers,Directors, Tech, and Stage Managers) must learn to Duty Manage. The Front of House Manager will run several training sessions a term, typically soon after a GM so pay attention as to when they are.
* If a member of the production team or cast knows that he/she will not be to able staff any performance of the show to which they have been assigned, they should inform their producer at least a week in advance. The producer should let the Front of House Manager know as soon as possible. Anyone who cannot staffone of their assigned performances should make alternative arrangements with the Front of House Manager to staff another show. 
* If for some reason, someone cannot staff within 24 hours of their staffing slot, a replacement staffer must be found before they can be unsigned by the Front of House Manager. 
* All of the above information applies to other shows as well, of course. Another production will staff the number of performances given to you by the initial GM vote (one Lunchtime performance and the five-night Mainterm run).
   * If either a Lunchtime or a Mainterm chooses to have an additional performance, it is the producer’s responsibility to find staffers for that performance.
   * It is the producer’s responsibility to find staffers for all extraordinary performances.
   
## Theatre Conversions and Saftey Issues
*Including Fire, Firearms, Pyrotechnics and Smoking*

* Theatres are second only to cardboard box factories in flammability. If you intend to have any of these in the performance you MUST discuss it with the Theatre Manager, and follow these regulations:
   * Naked flames/candles/pyrotechnics – can only be done with the permission of the Theatre Manager, who will liaise with the fire department.
   * Lasers – these need permission from the council which can take up to two months to come through.
   * Smoking  – is NOT permitted anywhere in the building, by law. If a show requires smoking, there are prop cigarettes in the prop store. Remember to put it in your Questionnaires if a smoke effect is being used at any point as the fire alarm has to be isolated.
   * Firearms – these need permission from the police. This can take some time so ask early. Speak to the Set Manager and the Theatre Manager.
   * Theatrical weapons – do not need permission from the police, but have nasty regulations surrounding transportation etc. Check with the Set Manager and Theatre Manager if you are unsure. The Bedlam has a Smith & Wesson cowboy style pistol and for general ease can be used instead of traipsing round Edinburgh looking for one. Bedlam also has a starter pistol with bright orange parts that makes a nice sound, but doesn’t look as realistic. Speak to the Set Manager and Theatre Manager if you want to use them and be aware that they may ask to put a box of blanks on your budget assuming you want to use blanks rather than a convincing sound effect (hint hint).
   * Weapons, real or theatrical, must only be used on the stage. If they are used in rehearsal they must be locked back in the armory at the end. This applies to performances as well.
 
 ## Tech 
 
* Before production week (the week before the show goes up) a rig plan should have been produced and attached to your tech questionnaire. The Tech Manager of your show should consult the tech manager of the building regarding the rig plan and their technical plans for the show so as to make sure that they are safe and comply with building regulations, but also so that the tech manager is able to prioritise the maintenance of required equipment. The Tech Manager of your show must also discuss hires with the tech manager - both, to make sure that you are not missing out on better deals the tech manager may be aware of, but much more so that the tech manager is aware of equipment that is hired regularly and can look into purchasing that equipment for the building.
* Rigging usually takes place in production week once the rig has been cleared from the last show. The tech manager of the show should consult with the tech manager of the building to find out when this will be appropriate. The tech manager of the show should also consult the tech manager of any Extraordinaries or annual events that are taking place between term-time shows - especially The Improverts. The Tech Manager of the extraordinary or annual event should also talk to the tech manager of the previous and next show to make sure that a reasonable amount of lanterns are rigged (i.e. Face-light, backlight etc.)
* Tech rehearsals are very important. They can take up a lot of time if everyone fidgets or treats them like a normal rehearsal. Try and keep the cast quiet and you will be finished quicker. The Tech teamis in charge of this rehearsal. The building tech manager will usually attend the get-in and may not be present but will be on call for the tech rehearsal, dress rehearsal and first night. Their contact details are posted in the Tech Box.
* Technical get outs include stripping the rig of fixtures that are not required for the next show and storing them in the lantern store, 'zeroing' patch (keeping fixtures required for the next show patched), returning the sound desk and all sound equipment to its default state, returning all other equipment to its correct storage area (gel frames, gels in the folders etc.) and tidying the tech box. This includes removing all cups, glasses, scripts, pieces of paper etc., clearing the work surface and vacuum cleaning the floor of the tech box.
* Technical managers of shows are required to give the building Technical Manager a list of any equipment that was faulty at the time of the get in, or any other equipment that was subsequently found not to work or damaged during the run of the show. There is a form for reporting faults in the tech resources section of the website, which can be found here: https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/admin/resources/tech. This is very important as it allows the technical manager to prioritise maintenance more effectively. It would be counterproductive for the technical manager of a show not to own up to damaged equipment as it may not be found to be faulty in time for the next show.If something which is required for your show breaks during your run, inform the tech manager of the building as soon as possible so they can do their best to fix it in time for your next performance.
* Planning is vital. Time for your get-in and get-out should be timetabled, but you will have to do extra work around this. Mainterms are usually expected to buy all paint, wood and other sundries, e.g. gaffer tape, which they use during the show. The Set Manager is usually flexible however and there should be room for some give and take in the budgets. Getting your SM to consult the Set Manager of the building is a very good idea, because they are a great source of advice and also will have the last word on what you can and can't use, what is safe and what isn't, etc.
* You can use any gel that’s in the gel store for your show, just be careful that you’re not wasting it by leaving big gaps. Any cut gel that can be reused goes into the relevant folder after your final performance, if it’s unusable (e.g. burned through or ripped) then it goes in the bin.

## Construction Regulations

* All wood must be painted on all sides facing the audience.
* If cardboard, paper, or polystyrene is to be used in set construction it must be passed by the theatre manager and treated with the necessary Flamebar flame retardant (N5, S3, or SIWA2). Check well in advance of your show to see if there is any in Bedlam, if large quantities of materials need to be treated then the show will have to purchase their own Flamebar. This must be accounted for in your budget. A good risk assessment will also be required.
* You cannot make any alterations to the building without express permission of the Committee. If you plan on changing the stage layout or the rake you will also need to apply for a theatre license from the council.
* Flame Check all drapes/swathes of material.
* Do not build or paint anything in the Café or Front of House unless you get permission from both the FOH Manager and the Theatre Manager.
* Café and Office furniture cannot be used on stage without permission from the Set Manager, and the FOH Manager.
* **IF YOU AREN'T SURE, ASK THE SET MANAGER**

## Archives

* The Archivist will want to take some photos, or have photos taken, before your performance. Make sure they have a copy of the programme (if you have one) and any posters or flyers to put in the archives. If you have any pictures or items to be archived feel free to hand them in to the Archivist.
* If you wish your production or aspects of rehearsal to be filmed or documented, contact the Archivist.


## General Advice

* If it all gets too much or you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask. The Committee is here to help you, and contact details are all on the website (https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/contact), or you can see them at a Company or Committee meeting. If you are not sure who is the right person to talk to, the Productions Manager should be able to point you in the right direction. You can bring up any questions or problems at Monday Company Meetings (18:30), or Thursday Committee Meetings (18:30), both at Bedlam
* Allow time to deal with unexpected problems. Try and make sure all the cast and crew know who you are and what is expected of them. Don’t let them boss you around.
