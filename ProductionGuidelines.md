## Proposing The Show

* The EUTC has a number of slots you can propose for, the difference between these will be detailed below.
* To propose a show you will need a Director, a Producer, a Stage Manager, and a Tech Manager. All of this team must be members of the EUTC before the proposal deadline. If they are not your proposal will be marked late, automatically giving you last preference in the vote at the General Meeting.
* Obtaining rights for non-original writing will also be discussed below. For the proposal you need to know whether the rights are available for the proposed run, and how much they would be. Try and get a proforma/prospective license drawn up with the rights company as you will need to process and pay them ASAP after passing at the GM, so rehearsals can legally begin.
* The show budget must be passed by the Business Manager prior to submitting the proposal. Be prepared to justify your expenses at the GM, e.g., ‘we need loads of hats, so our prop budget is £100’. 
* Your written proposal should include a blurb on each aspect of the production, i.e., direction, Tech, Stage, and publicity/fundraising. This will go in the Proposal Text section.
* Your written proposal must include enough information for the company to vote on. If your proposal 
    + does not have enough information
    + would break the law, or 
    + damage the theatre in the short or long term 
    
    it may not reach the GM.
* Proposals for the week 8 Mainterm slot must outline their desired extended get-in time and a comprehensive breakdown of what the time will be used for. The get-in schedule must be approved by the Set Manager before the form is submitted. The use of the get-in time must then be approved by the company as part of the production merit vote.You should also have a realistic plan for your get-out if you plan on having a large set.
* Production proposal forms are filled out on the Bedlam member’s website under ‘Proposals’. The deadline to hand in proposal forms is one week before the General Meeting in which the proposals will be voted on, usually 9pm the Wednesday before. If your proposal is not submitted before the deadline it will be marked late automatically giving you last preference in the vote at the GM. Past proposals may be viewed in the members section of the website under archived proposals.
* If your proposal passes committee, at the corresponding GM, the team will be asked to get up on stage and explain your proposal to the Company. You should meet beforehand to discuss what you are going to say in your presentation. Your team will have 3 minutes to give your proposal, then you will answer the questions of the company. These questions may be about the feasibility of any aspect of the production, or may ask you to explain anything that is not clear in the proposal text.
* You should speak to the Productions Manager for advice on your proposal before the GM.

## Types of proposal and Relevant Budgets

* Lunchtime
    * A Lunchtime slot has one performance on a Wednesday. This is at lunch time, hence the name. However, the time often fluctuates to fit requirement, so this can be on Wednesday evening.
    * The maximum funding from the EUTC for a Lunchtime is £125 for a show requiring rights, and £65 for a show not requiring rights. Rights, and performing original writing will be discussed later in the Guidelines.
    * A Lunchtime slot is an opportunity to put on a dramatically interesting show with limited resources.
        * It is also a very good first time slot for new teams and Directors or productions with more experimental elements, as it is a smaller scale than the Mainterm and more friendly.
    * If passed through the GM, shows can request a time change to the evening by coming to a Committee meeting. It is currently the norm for Lunchtimes to be performed in the evening but this still needs to be requested.
    * Shows can also request a second performance by raising the matter at a Company meeting. The second performance must take place on the Wednesday or Thursday evening following the Wednesday performance. If these are unavailable a second performance will not be possible. The criteria for a second performance being granted are as follows:
        * The team should have raised, or have a clear plan to raise, the money to pay the rights for the additional performance (if requiring rights).
        * For a lunchtime the Committee should be confident that the show shall sell at least ninety tickets between the two performances.
        * The additional performance must be requested at least 3 weeks before your first performance (if you are interested in this, try to request it the week after it passes at the GM).
* Mainterm
    * A Mainterm slot runs between three and five performances. The maximum funding from the EUTC for a Mainterm is £1050 for a show requiring rights, and £850 for a show not requiring rights. The committee should be confident that the show will sell at least 45 tickets for each additional performance up to 5 performances.
    * A Mainterm slot is traditionally a larger scale show.
    * Any change to the run indicated in the proposal has to be proposed at a Company Meeting at least three weeks before the run begins.
* Annual Event
