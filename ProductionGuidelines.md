## Proposing The Show

* The EUTC has a number of slots you can propose for, the difference between these will be detailed below.
* To propose a show you will need a Director, a Producer, a Stage Manager, and a Tech Manager. All of this team must be members of the EUTC before the proposal deadline. If they are not your proposal will be marked late, automatically giving you last preference in the vote at the General Meeting.
* Obtaining rights for non-original writing will also be discussed below. For the proposal you need to know whether the rights are available for the proposed run, and how much they would be. Try and get a proforma/prospective license drawn up with the rights company as you will need to process and pay them ASAP after passing at the GM, so rehearsals can legally begin.
* The show budget must be passed by the Business Manager prior to submitting the proposal. Be prepared to justify your expenses at the GM, e.g., ‘we need loads of hats, so our prop budget is £100’. 
* Your written proposal should include a blurb on each aspect of the production, i.e., direction, Tech, Stage, and publicity/fundraising. This will go in the Proposal Text section.
* Your written proposal must include enough information for the company to vote on. If your proposal 
    + does not have enough information
    + would break the law, or 
    + damage the theatre in the short or long term 
    
    it may not reach the GM.
* Proposals for the week 8 Mainterm slot must outline their desired extended get-in time and a comprehensive breakdown of what the time will be used for. The get-in schedule must be approved by the Set Manager before the form is submitted. The use of the get-in time must then be approved by the company as part of the production merit vote.You should also have a realistic plan for your get-out if you plan on having a large set.
* Production proposal forms are filled out on the Bedlam member’s website under ‘Proposals’. The deadline to hand in proposal forms is one week before the General Meeting in which the proposals will be voted on, usually 9pm the Wednesday before. If your proposal is not submitted before the deadline it will be marked late automatically giving you last preference in the vote at the GM. Past proposals may be viewed in the members section of the website under archived proposals.
* If your proposal passes committee, at the corresponding GM, the team will be asked to get up on stage and explain your proposal to the Company. You should meet beforehand to discuss what you are going to say in your presentation. Your team will have 3 minutes to give your proposal, then you will answer the questions of the company. These questions may be about the feasibility of any aspect of the production, or may ask you to explain anything that is not clear in the proposal text.
* You should speak to the Productions Manager for advice on your proposal before the GM.

## Types of proposal and Relevant Budgets

* Lunchtime
    * A Lunchtime slot has one performance on a Wednesday. This is at lunch time, hence the name. However, the time often fluctuates to fit requirement, so this can be on Wednesday evening.
    * The maximum funding from the EUTC for a Lunchtime is £125 for a show requiring rights, and £65 for a show not requiring rights. Rights, and performing original writing will be discussed later in the Guidelines.
    * A Lunchtime slot is an opportunity to put on a dramatically interesting show with limited resources.
        * It is also a very good first time slot for new teams and Directors or productions with more experimental elements, as it is a smaller scale than the Mainterm and more friendly.
    * If passed through the GM, shows can request a time change to the evening by coming to a Committee meeting. It is currently the norm for Lunchtimes to be performed in the evening but this still needs to be requested.
    * Shows can also request a second performance by raising the matter at a Company meeting. The second performance must take place on the Wednesday or Thursday evening following the Wednesday performance. If these are unavailable a second performance will not be possible. The criteria for a second performance being granted are as follows:
        * The team should have raised, or have a clear plan to raise, the money to pay the rights for the additional performance (if requiring rights).
        * For a lunchtime the Committee should be confident that the show shall sell at least ninety tickets between the two performances.
        * The additional performance must be requested at least 3 weeks before your first performance (if you are interested in this, try to request it the week after it passes at the GM).
* Mainterm
    * A Mainterm slot runs between three and five performances. The maximum funding from the EUTC for a Mainterm is £1050 for a show requiring rights, and £850 for a show not requiring rights. The committee should be confident that the show will sell at least 45 tickets for each additional performance up to 5 performances.
    * A Mainterm slot is traditionally a larger scale show.
    * Any change to the run indicated in the proposal has to be proposed at a Company Meeting at least three weeks before the run begins.
* Annual Event
    * Annual Events take place annually in roughly the same place in the schedule each year. The Productions Manager and the President decide at which GMs these are proposed. The Annual Events currently put on every year are:
        * Freshers’ Week (Festival)
        * Freshers’ Play
        * Freshers’ Slots
        * The Panto
        * Student/Bedlam Festival (Festival)
    * Annual Event proposals must have their budgets passed by the Business Manager. Ask the Productions Manager for more details if you are thinking of proposing for one of them.
* Extraordinary
    * Extraordinary slots are for any production or event which cannot reasonably meet the criteria of the above. It can be any kind of production which does not fall into a festival/annual event category.
    * These kind of events are for more experienced teams pushing the boundaries of what
Bedlam does, and what it can do.
    * Any proposal for an Extraordinary show that clashes with another EUTC show cannot go through. This includes allocated show slots.
    * There is no standing budget for Extraordinaries. However productions of this kind need to make back the entire budget from the EUTC through ticket sales and fundraising.
    * Extraordinary budgets must be passed by the Business Manager before submission.
## Business, Fundraising, and Budget Advice
* Keep track of the rights.
* The budget for your show should cover all costs, from lighting hire, costumes, rights, publicity, set design, plus 10% contingency (for emergencies). You must stick to the budget. All budgets should be passed by the Business Manager before proposing.
* Any budget increases or changes must be proposed at a Committee Meeting, and with consultation of the Business Manager. No one wants to have to retroactively fundraise.
* Each production will be required to submit a deposit check. The Business Manager will tell you how much it is. Deposit checks can be in the form of a check, or an envelope containing the correct cash. The check may be cashed for:
    * Missing rehearsal space with less than 24hr notice. Inform the secretary if you think this is going to happen.
    * Breaking things. Broken property of the Company may be replaced with money from the deposit.
    * Rehearsal space left in a mess. This includes the kitchen area when rehearsing in Bedlam. Clean up after yourselves.
    * Incomplete get-in or get-out. Put everything away and tidy up after your performance.
    * Missing training. All members of the production team must attend DM training.
* Invoices for any expense should be placed in Business Manager’s pigeonhole. This is the same for any receipts for reimbursements – remember to include name and bank details for each receipt. Make sure the Business Manager knows what needs to be payed urgently (such as rights), as well as keeping them up to date on your expenditure.
* Fundraisers can be proposed at any meeting of the Committee, every Thursday at 18:30. You
should give Committee as much notice as possible. Committee can reject a fundraiser if it
clashes with another EUTC event, or if there is insufficient evidence to vote on it. To propose a
fundraiser you should explain the following:
    * What you are intending to do.
    * How and where you are intending to do it.
    * A time and a date.
    * How much you are intending to fundraise.
* **All fundraised cash should be banked with the Business Manager.** You cannot spend any of
the fundraised money without it first being checked with the Business Manager.
* Anything you purchase with your show budget **is the property of the Company.**
* Keep a careful note of your budget. Remind all crew that they are not to spend ANY MONEY
without the producer’s say-so and that they MUST give you a receipt if they want to be
reimbursed.
* Any tech hires must be approved by the Technical Manager.
* If you have any problems, or questions for clarification there is a Business resources section on
the Bedlam website. If this does not answer your question then please talk to the Business
Manager.

## Rights

* If your piece is original writing by a member of the company then you will not need to pay for rights!
    * As a side note all original writing should be sent to the Bedlam Librarian: library@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
* Published versions of the play should include details of who to contact. Get rights ASAP. It sometimes takes a while for them to come through. You will need to inform them of the length of your run. Some playwrights will not allow any changes to the script, others may allow a certain amount; check this to avoid hassle later.
    * Rights are LEGALLY needed for rehearsals to begin which is why you should organise aprospective license/license invoice before the GM so you can send this to Business Manager for quick payment.
    * Allow 2 weeks in your schedule for rights to be paid so get them submitted ASAP after the GM
* To avoid paying too much, stress that it is an amateur production, by a non-profit making theatre company, in a student theatre with a capacity under 100.
* Check that the playwright is VAT registered as we can claim VAT back.
* You can ask actors to buy their own copy of the script. If you are going to photocopy them you should do it yourself and collect money from each cast member to pay for it. Scripts are not included in the show budget for copyright reasons.

## Auditions and Casting

* Typically auditions are the weekend after the GM between 2pm and 6pm, although they may be rearranged for scheduling issues. The Productions Manager will inform you of when and where they are. You will be asked beforehand which room in the building you would like for your auditions. Arrive at least fifteen minutes before the advertised audition times to get set up. 
* You will need to print and bring your own audition pieces (have at least 50 pieces photocopied) and a show blurb (plot description, performance date, character descriptions) to pin on the wall.
* Usually there will be two days of auditions and another day for call backs. Any actors recalled for more than one show fill out a preference form to make casting conflicts resolve easier. 
* A casting meeting between all shows will happen an hour or so after the call backs. This meeting will be chaired by the Produ
ctions Manager. Have your cast list ready with second and third choices just in case. Shows often share actors if they are willing to be in more than one. 

## Rehearsals

* You will have rehearsals in Bedlam and in Pleasance. The Secretary will book you three rehearsals a week. If you wish to rehearse more you can contact them at **secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk**
* Tell the Secretary your preferred rehearsal times and provide them with a full cast and crew list soon after you cast. Let them know if you need specific kinds of rehearsal rooms, e.g., if you intend to tap dance during rehearsals.
* You can book rehearsal space through the Bedlam Schedule website (schedule.bedlamtheatre.co.uk). You should use the same sign in as for the members section.
* Inform the Secretary as far in advance as possible if you need to cancel a rehearsal. Rooms in Pleasance have to be used if booked otherwise Pleasance may withhold rooms from us. If arranged in advance another team may be able to use the space, if you cannot swap a member of your production team will have to baby-sit the space.
* Rehearsals cannot take place in Bedlam until your production team has undergone Duty Manager training, and know how to lock up the building.
* You can also book extra rehearsal space in university buildings via MyEd. Contact the Secretary if you don’t know how to do this.

## Press and Publicity ##

* You need to make posters. Programmes are optional and can be a pricey addition to the budget. Flyers can be very effective — you can leave them in bars, cafes and other venues, or get people to hand them out for you.
* You can make these look however you want. However do not miss out the following:
   * Show name, time, venue (typically Bedlam), date, year, and price.
   * Bedlam logo –it must be clear Bedlam is the venue, the easiest way to do this is to use the Bedlam Theatre logo.
   * Spell check.
   * We recommend you include the words Edinburgh University Theatre Company on your poster.
   * Obey copyright law. If in  doubt, speak to the Marketing Manager
   * Any stipulations by the rights issuer supersede these recommendations. Check their specifications.
* A3 is a good size for posters, and the university won't allow anything larger, though experiment as you want since non-standard sizes can look more striking. Get the cast and crew to help you distribute them. Don't put your posters over other Bedlam posters (unless that show has finished). 
   * If you are putting them up in university buildings you will need the EUSA stamp. This can be obtained in the Potterrow Societies office.
* Put some posters up around Bedlam. It's a good idea to have some posters or flyers up in the building for the Lunchtimes/Mainterms a couple of weeks before your show goes up, even if it's not quite the finished article. Printing takes time depending on how much you pay. Teviot Print Shop is quick but slightly pricey, and there are cheap companies online you can use but remember to do it far enough in advance that they arrive in time – you want to be putting publicity up by at least the week before your show. 
* Generally, VAT is not paid on flyers, but it is on posters so check to see whether it has been included in any quotes. 
* Flyering is a good way to sell the show. You can't flyer in university buildings, but you can flyer outside them. Outside the library at lunchtime can be effective. You can exit flyer other shows at Bedlam, provided you get permission from the production team of said show.
* If you don't feel at all artistic, or are a bit stuck with ideas or technical know-how, then there are plenty of people who can help with posters. The Marketing Manager will be able to help or suggest people to ask.
* The Marketing Manager will ask to see your posters before they're printed to check that all Bedlam publicity is of a high standard. Logos are available on the Bedlam website, from the Productions Manager or from the Marketing Manager.
* Getting the press in for interviews, previews, or reviews will help sell the show. Get information out early, typically at least two weeks before the show. Keep reminding press about the show.
* Your show will be made public on the Bedlam website as soon as your publicity is finished. The faster you do this the longer you have to sell tickets. Some shows build their own website for extra advertising. If you need any help with this, or have questions about getting more information up on the website, contact the IT Subcommittee
* **Show Blurbs:**
   * These should be given to the Secretary for inclusion in the Company email (get it to them by Friday 10pm). If nothing new is received, then they will use the blurb from your show proposal form or make something up at their discretion.
   * Try to pick an exciting angle to sell the show.
* **Programmes:**
   * Try not to leave these till the last minute so you have time to proof read them. The Marketing Manager may also want to see them before they are printed. Don't forget to thank people who helped with the show.
   
##Questionnaires and Get-in##
   
* You will need to complete the following at least ten days your get-in starts. They are found at the bottom of your show page on the Bedlam members’ website. You will not be able to begin your get-in until they are all completed:
   * Tech Questionnaire
   * Producer Questionnaire
   * Stage Questionnaire
