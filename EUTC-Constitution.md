## ARTICLE 1: INTRODUCTION

### ARTICLE 1A: FOUNDATION

1. **Name:** The name of the society shall be the “Edinburgh University Theatre Company”, hereinafter referred to as “the EUTC” or “the Company”.
2. **Constitution:** This Constitution sets out the general foundation, structure, and mechanisms of the EUTC and is to be followed by all EUTC members. This Constitution supercedes all previous Constitutions and must be available to all EUTC members at all times.
3. **Dates:** All academic dates in this Constitution relate to the calendar of the University of Edinburgh.
4. **Development:** The EUTC is forever evolving as a society, and its structures and mechanisms will and must change over time. However, the spirit of its aims and principles will remain broadly the same. They must be borne in mind when conducting business and amending and interpreting the rest of the Constitution.
5. **The aims of the Company are:**\
    a) To encourage interest in and regularly produce varied types of theatre, both in the Bedlam Theatre and, where possible, elsewhere.\
    b) To accumulate and share theatrical knowledge and experience, for example through mentoring, workshops, collaboration, and hands on learning.\
    c) To provide an accommodating creative and social environment to encourage EUTC members’ development and self-improvement.\
    d) To enable and facilitate new writing and artistic innovation.\
    e) To foster links with the wider community with an outreach project and hire of the Bedlam Theatre.\
    f) To run the Bedlam Theatre and ensure its good condition.
6. The principles that the Company shall endeavour to follow are:\
    a) **Amateurism:** The EUTC is an amateur theatre company and conducts its activities on an amateur basis. However, this should not be taken as a reason to be unambitious.\
    b) **Community:** The EUTC is a social and supportive community and is collectively owned, in a moral sense, by its members.\
    c) **Collective responsibility:** All members with an active involvement in the Company must contribute to its running.\
    d) **Democracy:** Primary authority within the EUTC rests with the membership at large. As such, the EUTC is to be run as much as possible on principles of democracy, transparency, consensus, and consultation.\
    e) **Inclusivity:** The EUTC must be socially and structurally open to everyone, within the limits set out in this Constitution.

### ARTICLE 1B: LEGAL STATUS AND EUSA

1. **Society:** The EUTC is a society affiliated to the Edinburgh University Students’ Association (or “EUSA”). It shall follow all EUSA society regulations, unless an exception has been agreed with the relevant departments of EUSA.
2. **The EUTC is an unincorporated association,** without legal personality or charitable status independent of its members or EUSA. As such:\
    a) **Property** can only be permanently held (rather than legally owned) by the EUTC.\
    b) **Intellectual Property** created by an EUTC member is similarly owned by that member, who must approve all changes to it.\
    c) **Contracts** for the benefit of the EUTC are entered (and liability assumed) either by EUSA, or personally by a person approved by the Committee. When that person vacates their position, liability must be transferred to a successor as soon as possible.
3. **This Constitution** is a document internal to the EUTC. As such, if a clause of this Constitution (or any document deriving authority from it) contradicts a relevant licence or legal obligation, that clause is not valid and must not be followed. EUSA considers the ruling Constitution to be the version displayed on their website.
4. **Liaison:** The President shall be the primary contact with EUSA for general matters, the Business Manager for financial matters and the Theatre Manager for insurance, building and health and safety matters. However, they shall in practice act together as a liaison team.
5. **Data Protection:** The Company will ensure that it complies with any relevant data protection legislation. The Secretary shall act as Data Protection Officer.
6. **Practicalities** concerning the EUTC’s finances are described in Article 7A, while the Bedlam Theatre and its status is described in Article 7B.

## ARTICLE 2: MEMBERSHIP

1. **Student Membership** shall be open to all matriculated students of the University of Edinburgh.
2. **Non-student Membership:** Any other person may become a non-student member, provided that:\
    a) The membership fee for non-student members is twice that of student members. \
    b) At least 75% of extant members are student members.
3. **Equality:** Both student and non-student members are EUTC members, equally valued for their contributions to the Company. Neither this Constitution, nor any other EUTC rule or practice shall limit the relative rights of non-student members any more than EUSA’s society regulations require.
4. **Expiry:** EUTC membership expires at midday of the Monday immediately following Welcome/Freshers’ Week, unless it was bought/renewed after the 31st of August the same calendar year.
5. **Database:** The Secretary (see 4B/6) shall file a full membership list with EUSA at least once per semester. In any dispute over membership status, the EUSA lists shall be definitive.
6. **Honorary Life Membership:**\
    a) Honorary Life Membership may be conferred on any person as recognition for exceptionally dedicated or significant service to the Company, by a motion successfully passed at a General Meeting (see Articles 5B and 5E).\
    b) Such a motion must be proposed to the Chair in writing, with the signatures of at least 20 EUTC members, and be voted on with a secret ballot.\
    c) A person may reject Honorary Life Membership conferred upon themselves.\
    d) Honorary Life Membership is not a substitute for EUTC membership, though Honorary Life Members shall receive the same discounts on tickets and merchandise as members.

## ARTICLE 3: WELFARE, REPRESENTATION AND CONDUCT

### ARTICLE 3A: GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1. **Definition:** A welfare issue is one relating to Company activities that:\
    a) Is, has or may affect the wellbeing, health (physical or mental), safety or academic development of any EUTC member, or\
    b) Involves the bullying, harassment, coercion, assault, or intimidation of (or by) any EUTC member.
2. **Respect:**\
    a) All EUTC members deserve equal personal respect and courtesy, regardless of personal relationships, seniority, or position in the Company.\
    b) EUSA and the EUTC agree that discrimination and harassment, direct or indirect, based on a person’s sex, gender identity, age (except for licensing laws), race, skin colour, nationality, religious belief, socio-economic background, disability, HIV status, sexuality, family situation, domestic responsibilities or any other irrelevant distinction are detrimental to the Company and wider society, and must not be tolerated.
3. **Support:** Members should do their utmost to anticipate and prevent welfare issues and support those affected by them but are urged to act sensitively and responsibly when doing so.
4. **Speak out:** Members affected by welfare issues are encouraged to make those issues known but must not be penalised for feeling unable to do so.

### ARTICLE 3B: WELFARE CONTACTS

1. **Welfare contacts:** The EUTC shall have at least three welfare contacts, with equal responsibilities:\
    a) **A non-committee welfare contact** shall be elected at a General Meeting other than the AGM (see 5E/5). Their term expires one week after the end of the next Freshers’/Welcome Week. This person must not simultaneously be a member of Committee.\
    b) **The President** (see 4B/4) shall be a welfare contact by default. If the President cannot or does not feel they should continue in this role, the Committee shall select a substitute from among their number.\
    c) **Committee welfare contact:** The Committee shall select from their number a welfare contact to serve for the duration of that Committee’s term.\
    d) **If circumstances require,** an additional welfare contact may be appointed by the Committee or elected immediately following a motion passed at a General Meeting. The term must be of a fixed duration and not extend beyond a year.
2. **Welfare contact duties:**\
    a) Support those affected by welfare issues.\
    b) Support members in anticipating and preventing welfare issues.\
    c) With Company input, maintain and promote advisory welfare policies.\

    e) Propose welfare-focussed changes in policy to the Committee and Company.\
    f) Other welfare-relevant duties the Company, Committee, Production Guidelines, or this Constitution may assign.
3. **Considerations:** Welfare situations must be managed with sensitivity and discretion. The welfare contacts must be cautious, aware of their limitations in training and experience and aim to not take actions that risk creating further welfare issues. Their priorities are (generally, but not strictly in this order):\
    a) The wellbeing of people already affected, and their wishes regarding confidentiality.\
    b) The wellbeing of EUTC members generally.\
    c) Adherence to this Constitution.
4. **Other relevant people:** It may be more appropriate for other members to handle on-the-spot welfare concerns for a short period. Examples include:\
    a) At an EUTC social event, the Social Events Manager (see 4B/8).\
    b) At an EUTC meeting, the Chair (see 5A/3).\
    c) When the Bedlam Theatre is open to the public, the Duty Manager and Committee Representative (see 7B/6).

### ARTICLE 3C: LIBERATION REPRESENTATIVES

1. **Liberation representatives:** The EUTC shall have six liberation representatives, elected annually, to represent the five groups defined by EUSA, as well as a liberation representative to combat elitism in the EUTC. The particular terms used to refer to these groups shall be defined by the liberation representatives and their groups themselves.
2. **Liberation representatives duties:**\
    a) Serve as information points and contacts to their groups.\
    b) Organise activities to help their groups navigate the EUTC.\
    c) Handle concerns relevant to their groups, working with the rest of Committee.
3. **Elections:** Elections and the voting procedure of liberation representatives shall be selected and coordinated by the Committee, subject to ratification at a General Meeting. It is intended that members who self-identify as the groups vote on their representatives.
4. **Accountability:** All liberation representatives are subject to the same procedures as other elected positions as set out in Article 4, with exception to elections (see 3C/3).

### ARTICLE 3D: MEMBER CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES

1. **Member conduct obligations:** EUTC members must, in their conduct:\
    a) Not actively create any welfare issue as defined in 3A/1.\
    b) Not deliberately act against the long term-interests of the EUTC.\
    c) Act within the letter and the spirit of this Constitution.\
    d) Act within the law.\
    e) Act safely and responsibly.\
    f) Follow the University of Edinburgh Code of Student Conduct.
2. **Allegations of misconduct:** If it is alleged that a member has in their conduct disregarded these obligations, then the reacting party (i.e. the Committee or welfare contacts as appropriate) must choose whether to:\
    a) De-escalate the dispute with informal mediation, feed­­back and discussion.\
    b) Escalate the dispute internally, within the rules outlined in clauses 5 and 6 of this Article.\
    c) Refer the incident to an external body.

    a) Consider the welfare and dignity of all affected.\
    b) Act calmly and fairly, and without prejudice towards social grouping or any other irrelevant distinction.\
    c) Consider any relevant mitigating circumstances, in addition to the seriousness of any alleged misconduct.\
    d) Collect as much evidence and documentation about the allegation, its context and the reaction process as possible (while respecting data protection regulations, and personal boundaries and dignity).\

4. **Recusal:** Any member of the reacting party must recuse themselves if they are involved, named or directly implied in an allegation of misconduct.
5. **Warnings:** Upon escalation (see 3D/2b), the reacting party may issue a written warning to a member. One further written warning may be issued if the member’s conduct fails to improve.
6. **Revoking membership:**\
    a) EUTC membership can only be revoked by unanimous agreement of the welfare contacts, or by a motion passed unanimously at a Committee meeting, excluding recused members.\
    b) All other EUTC-internal avenues must have been explicitly exhausted, or be inappropriate in the given case, for revoking membership to be considered.\
    c) EUSA Activities must be notified (and given copies of all relevant evidence and documentation) whenever a person’s EUTC membership is revoked.\
    d) Any person whose membership is revoked may appeal the decision to EUSA Activities, whose decision is definitive and final.

## ARTICLE 5: MEETINGS

### ARTICLE 5A: GENERAL NOTES

1. **Types:** There shall be three types of meeting whose rulings hold authority for internal EUTC decisions - Committee, Company, and General - or collectively, “EUTC meetings”. Each has a different mandate, specified herein.
2. **Publicity:** The Secretary and President must go to reasonable lengths to publicise the time and location of EUTC meetings to the membership by the relevant deadline, specified herein.
3. **The Chair:** EUTC meetings shall be moderated by a member; the Chair. The Chair shall open and close the meeting, keep order and civility during the meeting and may adjourn for an intermission. By default, the Chair shall be the President or their appointee. If this person is absent, the members assembled shall informally agree on a Chair, who shall open the meeting. The Chair cannot vote at EUTC meetings, except to break a tie.
4. **The Clerk and the minutes:** EUTC meetings shall be minuted by a member; the Clerk. These minutes shall record all decisions and votes and be as accurate a record of the meeting as possible. By default, the Clerk shall be the Secretary or their appointee. If this person is absent, the Chair shall appoint a Clerk. The Secretary shall make minutes available to all members within a reasonable period.
5. **Recorded attendance:** Members must be recorded as present in the minutes to propose a motion, vote, or receive the means of voting (e.g. voting slips), on their own behalf or as a proxy (see 5F/3).
6. **Quorum:** Any motions proposed or votes conducted at EUTC meetings without the relevant quorum (specified herein) shall be considered invalid. The Chair and Clerk are included in quorum (see also 5F/3).
7. **Agenda:** The Chair shall decide the order of pre-arranged business. Unarranged motions, announcements or discussions within that meeting’s mandate may be presented to the Chair under “Any Other Competent Business” (AOCB).
8. **Neutrality:** The Chair shall remain neutral in discussion. If the current Chair or Clerk wish to actively debate, they must vacate their position and appoint a temporary replacement.
9. **Constitutional Interpretation:** When the meaning of a clause in this Constitution is uncertain, the Chair shall make a ruling as to how that clause is to be understood. Any member present may propose a motion to use an alternative interpretation, requiring a two thirds majority to overrule the Chair.
10. **Ejection:** Anyone consistently acting against this Constitution or obstructing the passage of a meeting may be asked to leave by the Chair. A motion may be immediately proposed for them to be allowed to remain, requiring only simple majority to be passed.
11. **Removing the Chair:** At any point, a motion may be proposed to remove the Chair:\
    a) If the Chair is considered to be acting against this Constitution, or\
    b) If their remaining as the Chair is otherwise inappropriate.
12. **Replacement:** If such a motion is passed, the Chair must stand down and the Clerk shall nominate another member present as a replacement. Anyone may demand the Clerk’s nomination be approved by YES/NO/ABS vote (see 5F/1a); if not approved with a two thirds majority, the Clerk shall nominate yet another member present as Chair, continuing until a replacement is found.

### ARTICLE 5B: PROCEDURE AND MOTIONS

1. **Auditorium Analogy:** When motions are proposed or a similar level of formality is required, an auditorium analogy shall be used by the Chair to govern speaking rights. For a member present to speak, the Chair must “give” them either “the stage” or “the rake” (i.e. seating rake). The meeting-place shall therefore be split between:\
    a) **The Chair** (with the Clerk)\
    b) **The stage:** members holding the stage shall pitch and drive forward the topic of discussion (motion, show proposal or otherwise)\
    c) **The rake:** any member present (except the Chair and stage-holder) may hold the rake to pose questions, raise concerns or amend the topic of discussion, as appropriate.
2. **Speaking rights:** Multiple members may hold the stage at the same time, at the Chair’s discretion. The stage-holder and the rake-holder have the right to be heard without undue obstruction from each other or anyone else; the Chair shall enforce this.
3. **Points of order** are queries concerning the procedure outlined in this Constitution, addressed to the Chair who shall make a ruling as appropriate (see 5A/9). Only the Chair and members raising a point of order may interrupt the current stage-holder or rake-holder.
4. **Motions:** General rulings requiring the authority of an EUTC meeting shall be proposed in the form of a motion; a specific procedure outlined below.
5. **Basis of motions:** Motions must not imply or encourage illegality, be self-referential, be prohibited by this Constitution, or be designed to create paradox within it. Unless otherwise stated, motions shall take effect when the meeting they were proposed at is closed.
6. **Proposing a motion:** Any member present may propose a motion at an appropriate point in the meeting. If seconded by another member present, the proposer will be given the stage and is entitled to a speech, duration specified by the Chair.
7. **Questions:** The Chair shall then ask if there are any questions. Members asking questions shall be given the rake.
8. **Amendments:** The Chair shall then ask if there are any amendments to the motion. Members proposing amendments shall be given the rake and pitch the amendment to the Chair, who will ask the stage-holder if they agree with it. The stage-holder may then either:\
    a) State they accept the amendment, meaning their motion is modified accordingly unless another member demands further discussion through a change of roles.\
    b) Suggest an improvement to the amendment. If the rake-holder approves, they shall re-propose their amendment. The Chair may permit a certain amount of back-and-forwarding to agree on exact wording.\
    c) Suggest a change of roles themselves.\
    d) Reject the amendment, meaning the rake-holder may either withdraw the amendment or demand further discussion through a change of roles.
9. **Change of Roles:** When a change of roles is demanded, the proposer of the amendment shall become the stage-holder and propose the amendment like a separate motion, but only minor further amendments to this are permitted. Once the amendment has been voted on, the original proposer of the motion may take the stage again or they may ask the proposer of the amendment to remain the stage-holder.
10. **Direct negatives:** The Chair shall then ask if any member present would like to propose a direct negative to the motion. This is not an amendment, a motion or a veto, but a chance for a member to take the stage and voice opposition to the motion.
11. **Just before voting,** the main parties to the debate can briefly summarise their positions. Only points of order (see 5B/3) may be raised by this point.
12. **YES/NO/ABS voting** by two thirds majority (see 5F/1a) shall be used for all votes concerning motions, unless stated otherwise in this Constitution.

### ARTICLE 5C: COMMITTEE MEETINGS

1. **Voting rights:** Any EUTC member may attend a Committee Meeting, but only members of the EUTC Committee can vote.
2. **Quorum:** The quorum for Committee Meetings shall be Committee Members and any two additional EUTC members, five in all.
3. **Function and mandate:** Committee Meetings primarily serve as a forum for Committee to report developments in their areas of responsibility and discuss matters of mutual interest. Committee Meetings may only rule on:\
    a) Issues that this Constitution (and documents deriving authority from it) specifically say that they can, or \
    b) Issues within the areas of responsibility delegated to Committee by the Company (although major decisions and long-term changes of direction must be referred to a General Meeting whenever possible), or \
    c) Preliminary and temporary resolutions to immediate and pressing issues that must be referred to a General Meeting as soon as possible.
4. **Regularity:** Committee Meetings shall occur weekly throughout the academic year, at as consistent a time and place as circumstances allow. Additional Committee Meetings may be called by the President or Secretary with 24 hours written or email notice to the Company, or no notice at all if held immediately before a General Meeting.
5. **Motions** at a Committee Meeting require only a simple majority to be approved.

### ARTICLE 5D: COMPANY MEETINGS

1. **Voting rights:** All EUTC student members attending are entitled to a vote at a Company Meeting.
2. **Quorum:** The quorum for Company Meetings shall be five EUTC student members.
3. **Function and mandate:** Company Meetings primarily serve as a channel of formal communication between production teams and the Company. They may only rule on those issues that this Constitution (and documents deriving authority from it) specifically say that they can.
4. **Regularity:** Company Meetings shall occur weekly throughout the academic year, at as consistent a time and place as circumstances allow. Additional Company Meetings may be called by the President or Secretary with 24 hours written or email notice to the Company.

### ARTICLE 5E: GENERAL MEETINGS

1. **Voting rights:** All EUTC student members are entitled to a vote at a General Meeting (or GM).
2. **Quorum:** The quorum for GMs shall be either 30 members or 10% of the current membership, whichever is lower.
3. **Mandate:** GMs have the authority to rule on any issue within the Company’s control, if not prohibited by this Constitution. If a ruling made at a Company or Committee Meeting or at a previous GM is outwith that meeting’s mandate or against the interests of the EUTC, it can be overruled by a motion successfully passed at a GM.
4. **Regularity:** There shall be at least one GM every semester. GMs may be called by the President, Secretary, or a petition of members equal to the quorum of a GM. The Company must be given 14 days written or email notice of all GMs, including those that are preplanned.
5. **The Annual General Meeting (AGM)** shall be a GM taking place on a date in the second semester that has been approved by EUSA.
6. **Alteration to this Constitution** may only be performed by a motion successfully passed at a GM. Such a motion must include details of the specific clause(s) to be altered, deleted or added. The Committee must be notified of such a motion at least 7 days before the GM, so it can be added to the agenda and the membership notified, as they must be, a few days before the GM.

### ARTICLE 5F: VOTING

1. Two types of voting shall be used:\
    a) **YES/NO/ABS voting,** when the outcome of a vote must be a binary yes or no. This may be by any fair and practical method specified by the Chair. However, if required by this Constitution or requested by any member present at a meeting, a secret ballot must be used. An abstention shall count towards the meeting’s quorum, but not the outcome of the vote.\
    b) **The Single Transferrable Vote** (or “STV”), when a preference is required between multiple candidates. The EUTC shall use the Scottish STV method, with the Droop Quota formula. “None” shall always be a valid option in any STV vote. If, by the end of processing, “none” has ranked higher than any true candidates, then those candidates are not selected even if unfilled positions remain.
2. **Secret ballots:**\
    a) **Automated:** Before a GM, a computer should be set up for processing votes. The formulae or source code of the counting software must be available to any member on request.\
    b) **Manual:** If a computer cannot be set up, votes shall be counted manually by two vote-takers selected by the Chair for their competence and impartiality. Their names shall be recorded in the minutes. Any member may observe a manual count.\
    c) **Online:** If a vote is performed online, any member may email the secretary to receive a voter token the day of the vote. Proxying (see 5F/3) is not
applicable for an online vote.

3. **Proxy votes:**\
    a) A member that cannot attend a GM may delegate their voting rights to another member by nominating them as their proxy.\
    b) A member may only act as a proxy for one other member. They exercise the proxy vote in addition to their own voting rights.\
    c) The Clerk must record proxy attendance separately to physical attendance.\
    d) Proxy nominations must be ratified at the beginning of the GM at which they are to be exercised. Any member present may raise an objection, in which case ratification must be voted on with a secret ballot.\
    e) Once ratified, a proxy vote may count towards the quorum of the GM.
4. **Record:** The Clerk must record the numerical results of all votes and make them available as soon as possible after the meeting.
5. **Re-counts and re-votes:**\
    a) If events occur before or during a meeting that bring the result of a vote into question, a re-count or re-vote may be ordered by the Chair of that meeting, or by a motion passed to that effect. \
    b) If a re-count or re-vote does not occur at that meeting, the numerical result of the vote is held to be valid. However, this does not prevent the matter being revisited at a future meeting if appropriate.

## ARTICLE 6: SHOWS AND OTHER EVENTS

### ARTICLE 6A: PRODUCTION GUIDELINES, CALENDAR AND CLASSIFICATIONS

1. **Statement of Intent:**\
    a) For the EUTC to fulfil its aims, it is essential that creative freedom and trial and error are nurtured in its members and productions. \
    b) However, a well-defined and fair set of rules and responsibilities applying equally to all proposal and production teams is an important part of running a complex theatre society and public venue.\
    c) Similarly, while the EUTC does not exist to make a profit, it must remain a going concern. The Business Manager and others shall work with teams to maximise profitability while compromising on (a) as little as possible (see also 7A/3).
2. **The Production Guidelines (PGs):**\
    a) **Use:** The PGs are primarily the working regulations of the EUTC with respect to shows and festivals, deriving authority from this Constitution. Sections that do not define a rule should be clearly distinguishable, by formatting or phrasing. Teams agree to follow the regulations in the PGs from when they first submit their proposal.\
    b) **Review:** The Committee (led by the Productions Manager) shall review the PGs at least once a year to ensure their clarity, accuracy, and relevance. The Company must be consulted on all changes, and changes must be ratified at a General Meeting (GM) to take effect. A motion passed at a GM may trigger an additional review, to be carried out in the same way.\
    c) **Contradiction:** If a section of the PGs contradicts this Constitution, then this Constitution shall take precedence. The Committee must remove the contradiction as soon as possible, which may involve proposing amendment of the PGs or this Constitution.\
    d) **Exceptions:** The Committee may suspend a section of the PGs if it is in the interests of the EUTC as a whole to do so. This suspension must be of fixed duration and not extend beyond the next GM.
3. **Calendar:** After Company consultation, the Committee (led by the Productions Manager) shall produce a provisional calendar for the coming year. Time in each available room (including preparation time, if relevant) shall be divided between the following:\
    a) Company-selected shows, whose proposal process is defined in Article 6B.\
    b) Festivals, described in Article 6C.\
    c) Other events, including socials, workshops, hires and meetings.\
    d) Unspecified time, which may be left empty or used for rehearsals, maintenance etc.
4. Events on the calendar shall also be either:\
    a) **Reserved,** where the Committee assumes that an event of a particular type will occur and reserves time for it, even though the event itself may not yet have been proposed.\
    b) **Supplementary,** where the Committee does not include an event in the calendar prior to receiving proposals. Supplementary events may be proposed to take place either in unspecified time, or in time already allocated to a reserved event or a supplementary event already selected. In these latter cases, permission to proceed must be obtained both from the Committee, and the team for the affected event (if such a team has already been selected).
5. **Further classification** of events is outlined in the PGs, which must specify any classification-specific details of budgets, time granted in venues, required roles on a production team etc.

### ARTICLE 6B: THE SELECTION PROCESS

1. **Open applications:** The Productions Manager shall make application forms available for all classifications to be selected at the next General Meeting (GM), specifying the number of slots available for each.
2. **Submission Deadline:** A first draft of a written proposal must be submitted before the submission deadline. The Committee will review the proposals and offer advice if appropriate, which the proposal team may choose to ignore.
3. **Editing deadline:** Proposals cannot be edited after the editing deadline. Subsequently, the Committee must approve any proposal that, after the Committee have given their advice, fulfill all of the following requirements:\
    a) Not obviously illegal or in breach of a relevant licence or insurance policy.\
    b) Contains enough information for the GM to make an informed decision on its production merit.\
    c) Sincerely intended as a proposal.\
    d) Does not clash with an existing or reserved EUTC event, without permission (see 6A/4b).\
    e) Explicitly names a core production team of EUTC members (see also 7C/4b). The roles required of each classification shall be specified in the Production Guidelines.
4. **Release:** All other written proposals must be promptly made available to all EUTC members.
5. **Pitch:** At the GM, proposal teams are given the stage (see 5B/1), and are entitled to a speech followed by questions from the rake of a duration decided by the Chair. If the vote is to be delivered online, no such pitch is necessary, but showteams must congress within the auditorium to receive online and in person questions. Responses must be announced online live.
6. **Production Merit:** All proposals must pass a production merit vote before they can be included on a preference ballot. This is a YES/NO/ABS vote (see 5F/1a) by mandatory secret ballot. The proposal must meet the following criteria with a two thirds majority:\
    a) The team are ready and able to fulfil their proposal.\
    b) The production would not be detrimental to the EUTC’s interests, principles or reputation, or the welfare of its members. \
In the case of online votes, production merit is voted on the day prior to the show vote.
7. **Preference vote:** All proposals that have passed their production merit vote must be included on an STV preference ballot (see 5F/1b). If there are multiple slots available for that classification, the proposal that achieves first preference shall have first choice of slot. 
8. **Unfilled slots:** If a slot for a reserved show is unfilled by the conclusion of that classification’s preference vote, a motion shall be proposed to either:\
    a) Leave it as unspecified time.\
    b) Reopen applications for the next GM.\
    c) Immediately allocate the time to a proposal of another classification, if logistically possible.
9. **Mandatory events:** A reserved show or festival classification may be designated “mandatory” in the Production Guidelines. If a proposal for a mandatory event has not been selected at a GM by a sensible time, the Committee shall act as the production or festival team until such a team has been selected.
10. **Original writing:** When original writing by an EUTC member is proposed, the writer must approve by email to the Committee the choice of Producer and Director, along with any later changes to these two positions.
11. **Vacancies:** If a position on the core team of a show (see 6B/3e) falls vacant for any reason, a replacement must be ratified at a Company or General Meeting.

### ARTICLE 6C: FESTIVALS

1. **Definition:** A Festival is an extended event where the Committee delegate many of their duties to a Subcommittee (see Article 4C).
2. **Similarities to shows:**\
    a) Festivals must follow rules laid out in the Production Guidelines (see 6A/2).\
    b) Festivals proposals are selected by the same process as shows (see Article 6B).\
    c) Festivals may be reserved or supplementary events (see 6A/4) and may be declared mandatory (see 6B/9).
3. **Differences to shows:**\
    a) Festival teams select, support and coordinate performances under their banner, but do not directly run them.\
    b) Festivals may curate their own performances, workshops, socials, marketing, prices, menus, show selection process, etc.\
    c) After a proposal has been selected, Festivals are run as a Subcommittee.

### ARTICLE 6D: SHOW RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUSPENSION

1. **Production teams’ collective responsibilities:**\
    a) Act openly and honestly when providing information to the Committee or Company, and inform the Committee of any significant or irregular developments with regards to their production.\
    b) Within reason, follow all relevant rules set out in the Production Guidelines (see 6A/2a), any other relevant regulations in this Constitution, and any direct instructions from the Committee specific to their production.
2. **Show suspension:** As a last resort, a motion passed at a Committee Meeting may suspend a production if:\
    a) The production team have substantially neglected their responsibilities as described in 6D/1, to the significant detriment of the EUTC.\
    b) Any relevant performance rights have not been obtained or have been revoked.\
    c) The production as planned would be unavoidably illegal, or invalidate or contradict a relevant licence or insurance policy.\
    d) The production as planned would unavoidably create significant welfare issues or present an unacceptable safety risk.
3. **Consequences:** Without the express permission of the Committee, a suspended production and its team may not:\
    a) Claim for expenses from the EUTC, other than those incurred before the date of suspension.\
    b) Use rehearsal space allocated to them by the EUTC.\
    c) Perform, including to an audience of only EUTC members.
4. **Resolution:** The suspended status of a production may be removed by a motion passed at a Committee Meeting if the Committee judges the issues that caused the suspension suitably resolved or mitigated (see also 5E/3).

## ARTICLE 7: PRACTICALITIES

### ARTICLE 7A: FINANCES

1. **The EUTC’s finances,** revenue and expenditure are an integrated part of EUSA’s departmental budgeting and accounting system. Beyond this, the financial arrangements of the EUTC are presently vague, unclear and largely unwritten. The Committee, led by the Business Manager (see 4B/1), shall attempt whenever possible to:\
    a) Clarify, formalise and update the EUTC’s financial relationship with EUSA.\
    b) Update this Constitution with new and verified information concerning this.\
    c) Inform and educate interested Company members about the financial status of the EUTC.
2. **The EUTC’s financial year** shall run from the 1st April to the 31st March inclusive.

4. **Pay and reimbursement:** No EUTC member shall receive any monetary payment or benefit, direct or indirect, unless as reimbursement for legitimate expenses incurred (see also 1A/7a). This does not apply to labour paid for by Bedlam Fringe (see Article 8), or when EUTC members are acting in their capacity as EUSA employees.
5. **Legitimate expenses:** Any expenditure not approved by the Business Manager in advance shall be the liability of the person making it. The Business Manager may refuse to reimburse illegitimate expenditure, meaning that they consider the expense to be either:\
    a) Unrelated to EUTC activities.\
    b) Explicitly described as ineligible for reimbursement in the Production Guidelines (see 6B/2). \
    c) Greater than the budget allocated for that event, project or task.\
    d) Fraudulent.
6. **Annual financial report:** The Business Manager shall ensure that the Company’s draft budget and annual financial report is complete, and that it is presented at the AGM (see 5E/5) and submitted to all relevant departments of EUSA along with the annual report.

### ARTICLE 7B: THE BEDLAM THEATRE

1. **The Bedlam Theatre** is owned by the University of Edinburgh, leased to EUSA (in a similar manner to Teviot Row House), and operated by the EUTC. Beyond this the building and insurance status of the EUTC is presently vague, unclear and largely unwritten. The Committee, led by the Theatre Manager (see 4B/10), shall attempt whenever possible to:\
    a) Clarify, formalise and update the EUTC’s buildings relationship with EUSA and the University.\
    b) Update this Constitution with new and verified information concerning this.\
    c) Inform and educate interested Company members about the legal and practical status of the EUTC, its operation and its relationships.
2. **Significant changes** to the status or use of the Bedlam Theatre and proposals for major or disruptive refurbishment (see also 4C/6b) must be approved by a motion successfully passed at a General Meeting before the Committee can consent to these changes being executed.
3. **Licences, health and safety and the law** with respect to the Bedlam Theatre are the responsibility of the Theatre Manager, but all EUTC members should assist with ensuring adherence to these conditions whenever possible.
4. **Insurance:** The EUTC shall provide funds for the Theatre Manager to purchase personal liability insurance relevant to their role.
5. **Staffing** shall be administrated by the Front of House (FOH) Manager (see 4B/2).
6. **Staff authority:** While the Bedlam Theatre is open to the public:\
    a) There must be on duty a Duty Manager (DM), a Committee Representative (CR), and a number of other staffers fulfilling roles specified by the FOH and Theatre Managers in written guidance.\
    b) The DM and CR on duty have the joint authority to do whatever is necessary to maintain public safety and legal adherence, within the boundaries set out in the law and any relevant licence conditions. This includes but is not limited to cancelling a performance and ejecting persons from the premises. Any actions taken by the DM and/or CR in this capacity shall have the full support of this Constitution and the Committee.
7. **Training and policy:** The FOH and Theatre Managers shall:\
    a) Ensure all DMs and CRs are adequately and regularly trained.\
    b) Maintain a list of qualified DMs.\
    c) Construct policies to assist and guide the decision-making process of the DM and/or CR.

### ARTICLE 7C: IN DEBT TO THE COMPANY

    a) Staffing a certain number of slots, as specified by the FOH Manager. Slots where a member acts as Committee Representative do not count towards this number.\
    b) Attending and participating in maintenance sessions, as specified by the Theatre Manager.\
    c) If circumstances insist, performing other tasks considered equivalent to (a) and (b), as agreed between the member and the FoH or Theatre Managers.
2. **A member is in debt to the Company if:**\
    a) They have not committed to staff their specified number of slots within a sensible timeframe clearly set beforehand by the FoH Manager.\
    b) They have not attended a maintenance session within a sensible timeframe clearly set beforehand by the Theatre Manager.

    b) Be included as a core member of a show proposal team with reference to 6B/3e.\
    c) Become involved in any current production to which they have not already committed.
    
### ARTICLE 7D: CHARITY

1. **Foundation**: The EUTC will annually partner with a charitable organisation compatible with its aims and principles
2. **Selection**: The charity shall be selected at the first General Meeting of Semester 1 and use STV Voting (see 5F/1b). Any charity nominated by two members shall be an option, along with the charity for the previous year and “None”.
3.	**Effect**: Committee positions shall manage the effects of the partnership within their own remits. Productions may individually reject involvement.
4.	**Removal**: A motion successfully passed at a Committee Meeting or a GM may unaffiliate the EUTC with the charity.
5.	**Re-selection**: If the EUTC is without a charity, a selection process will be held at the next GM (see 7D/2).



## ARTICLE 8: FRINGE

1. **Bedlam Fringe** is administratively separate from the EUTC and has its own relationship with EUSA, distinct from that between EUSA and the EUTC. Its operations are managed by a Fringe Venue Manager (FVM), while its programme is curated by a Head of Programming (HOP).
2. **FVM appointment:**\
    a) The FVM and HOP are appointed by a panel including a representative of the EUTC Committee.\
    b) As soon as possible after appointment, the FVM and HOP shall attend an EUTC General Meeting to introduce themselves and state their plans for the coming Fringe.\
    c) The FVM and HOP may then appoint a team with a structure of their choosing.
3. **Handover:** From the 1st of June to no later than one week before Freshers/Welcome Week, Bedlam Fringe shall have operational control of any assets, equipment, and buildings the EUTC may hold or occupy. Dates may be changed by agreement between the FVM and the EUTC Committee.
4. **EUTC shows:** The HOP allocates at least one slot in its schedule to the EUTC. For selection purposes, the EUTC shall treat this as a reserved show classification (see 6A/4a), regulated by the Production Guidelines.
5. **EUTC status:** The EUTC shall continue to exist with this Constitution in force during this time.
6. **Cooperation** between the EUTC and Bedlam Fringe is essential. For its part, the EUTC Committee shall make every effort to ensure good dialogue occurs.
7. **Personal liability:** Where EUTC members are personally liable in a contract or licence entered for the benefit of the EUTC, Bedlam Fringe must actively consult those members on matters relevant to that contract or licence.

## ARTICLE 9: ALUMNI

1. **FOB:** The EUTC’s recognised alumni association is Friends of Bedlam (FOB) - a body independent of the EUTC.
2. **Links:** The EUTC shall maintain strong links with its alumni, primarily through FOB, drawing on and sharing in their experience, both in times of crisis and also if nothing is happening.
3. **Alumni Liaison Officer:** The EUTC President (or their nominated representative) shall take the role of Alumni Liaison Officer, assisted by the Archives Subcommittee (especially with matters of historical or archive interest).
4. **FOB Committee:** In accordance with the FOB Constitution, the Alumni Liaison Officer shall attend FOB Committee meetings with full voting rights.
5. **Alumni Fundraising:** The EUTC Committee shall consult the FOB Committee for matters related to EUTC and University of Edinburgh alumni fundraising. The Alumni Liaison Officer shall take responsibility for the planning of alumni fundraising from the EUTC end.

## ARTICLE 10: POSTSCRIPT

1. **Don’t Stop Believing:** The Company believes that the EUTC will continue, in one form or another, indefinitely. However, if it becomes a necessity, the EUTC may only be dissolved by a motion successfully passed at a General Meeting. Any assets it may hold at dissolution shall be distributed among causes friendly to it, and as much as possible compatible with its aims and principles.
