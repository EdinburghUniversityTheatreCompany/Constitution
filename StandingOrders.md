2.2 Only members recorded as present, or who have obtained a proxy vote, may be eligible to vote in General Meetings or meetings of the Company where shows are selected.

2.3 If a member recorded as present should leave a meeting, that member’s voting papers (including any proxies they may hold) cannot be used and must be surrendered to the Chair. These voting papers may be recovered from the Chair if the member returns to the meeting

3.0 Motions

3.1 Constitutional amendments may be passed at a General Meeting, open to all members, 14 days’ notice of which shall be given. Motions for amendment of the Constitution or Standing Orders must be submitted to the Committee for inclusion on the agenda at least a week in advance of the relevant meeting. Other motions may however be included in ‘Any Other Competent Business’ (AOCB), or under the relevant business without notification. All motions must have a proposer and a seconder in order to be competent for discussion.

3.2 On presentation of the motion, the Chair will ask if there are any direct negatives to it, or amendments to it. In the absence of both, the motion is carried unanimously. Any member may propose an amendment, direct negative, or demand that the motion is put to vote, they shall have the same rights as the proposer of the motion.

3.3 Amendments to the motion shall be debated prior to the direct negatives, and shall be taken in turn. The proposer of the motion may accept an amendment without putting it to a vote if they wish. If a member objects to the change, a vote must be taken on the amendment.

3.4 If an amendment is carried, it becomes incorporated in the original motion and the proposer of the amendment may assume the role of proposer of the motion if they wish. The amended motion is then proposed in place of the original.

3.5 Motions shall take effect upon the adjournment of the meeting (unless otherwise stated in the motion). No motion shall be self-referential, or designed to entail paradox within the Constitution or Standing Orders of the EUTC.

3.6 All motions shall be governed by the voting rules as outlined in the points below.

3.6.1 If an amendment is put forward, the proposer of the amendment shall speak first, followed by the proposer of the original motion. If a direct negative is put forward, the proposer of the motion shall speak first, followed by the challenger.

3.6.2 Points of order (relating to the rules of this document) shall be addressed to the Chair who shall make a ruling as necessary. Only members raising a point of order to the Chair and the Chair may interrupt the current speaker.

3.6.3 Any member may put a motion to a vote at any point in a meeting. The Chair shall then make a ruling or request a show of hands. On moving to a vote, both sides shall sum up, in reverse order from which they originally spoke, both sides may waive their right to do so. Only points of order may be raised at this stage. The result of the vote must be recorded in the minutes.

3.6.4 Any member consistently contravening the Standing Orders or Constitution of the EUTC or deliberately obstructing the passage of the meeting may be asked to leave by the Chair. The member asked may propose a motion allowing them to remain; simple majority shall decide this.

3.6.5 Any member given the floor shall have the right to be heard without undue interference.

3.7 Motions for the election of an Honorary President, Honorary Vice Presidents and Honorary Life Members are governed by these additional points. The election must be submitted in writing, and seconded by at least 20 other members. The written nomination must include the name and signature of all the nominating members. This election will be decided by mandatory secret ballot, and may not be decided by show of hands.

Section B

1.0 Conduct

1.1 All members shall make best endeavours to act in the long-term interests of the EUTC and any building(s) it occupies whilst on company business. The Committee may require or prevent activities on this basis. Any decision taken under this clause may be overruled by vote against at a meeting of the Company. Where a show’s priorities are opposed to those of the EUTC, the EUTC shall take precedence.

1.2 Additional Health and Safety measures. All members of the EUTC shall behave in accordance with any Health and Safety guidelines as specified by the Committee. This is additional to the legal HSE requirement of the Constitution section 8.

1.3 Duty of Information: all production teams shall seek the advice of the Committee on any significant or unusual activity relating to their show prior to proposing and/or undertaking such activity. This includes (but is not limited to) any production team member taking on any additional roles or responsibilities in the production which could provide a conflict of interest. All members must act openly and honestly whilst giving information to a meeting of the Committee or Company.

1.4 All members of the EUTC shall behave in accordance with the Welfare Agreement at all times. The President shall be an official and confidential contact for all matters of welfare. At the start of their term, the Committee shall appoint an additional committee welfare contact.

1.5 Failure to disclose later significant or unusual activity intended before a production merit vote (as outlined in Standing Orders B, Section 1.3) will render the proposal invalid and the production will be suspended pending a General Meeting in which the production merit vote will be held once again in light of the new information. If the performance dates are before the next available date for a General Meeting, the show may be cancelled. The decision to suspend a production will be decided by a vote of the Committee, using the following criteria:

    Have the team failed to act openly and honestly in meetings of the Committee and/or Company?

    Does the activity in question change the proposal substantially enough as to invalidate the production merit vote taken by the Company?

1.6 Suspended Shows: In the event of suspension, no spending will be approved for the production in question during that period, and the production may lose access to the building for rehearsals, at the discretion of the Theatre Manager.

2.0 Show Proposals

2.1 Any member who is not in debt to the Company may propose to direct, produce, stage-manage or tech a show.

2.2 All proposed shows must have a director, a producer, a stage manager and a technician.

2.3 All shows except Extraordinary proposals, must be proposed and selected at a General Meeting of the EUTC. All General Meetings must be announced with at least two weeks’ notice.

2.4 Any member may stand to fill vacant posts within a production team at any meeting of the Company.

2.5 Positions on a proposal must be filled by a Company member at the time of the proposal deadline. Failure to ensure this, or any subsequent change to the proposal form without the consent of the Committee, renders the proposal late. If the positions have not been filled by the selection meeting the proposal is void.

2.6 Before any show may be put forward to preference vote it must have passed a production merit vote. (See clause 8.0 below). The criteria for this vote are: i): Is the production team of sufficient competence to fulfil their proposal? ii): Is the production of sufficient artistic value? iii): Will the production operate in the best long-term interests of the EUTC?

3.0 Shows

3.1 A Lunchtime is a single performance of a dramatic production, which takes place on a Wednesday lunchtime. An extra performance may take place if the show has sound grounds for doing so. The Committee shall be competent to decide this and shall allot a time for the performance to take place. Any motion to overrule their decision shall come in the form of a vote against the Committee’s decision at a meeting of the Company. A Lunchtime may take place inside or outside of the building.

3.2 A Mainterm is a dramatic production that takes place in an early evening slot, allotted to it by the EUTC. It may have no fewer than three performances. If deemed practical by the Committee a Mainterm may also apply for a matinée slot. Any motion to overrule their decision shall come in the form of a vote against the Committee’s decision at a meeting of the Company. The production team shall indicate the length of run at the time of proposal. Any change to the run shall be proposed at a Company Meeting not less than three weeks before the run begins. This cannot affect any other pre-arranged EUTC event. A Mainterm may take place inside or outside of the building.

3.3 An Annual Event is an event, whether it be a production or otherwise, that takes place annually in roughly the same place in the schedule each year. The Productions Manager and the President will decide at which GMs these events are proposed and in which weeks these events take place. The following shall be Annual Events: Freshers’ Week (Festival), Freshers’ Play, Freshers’ Slots, The Panto, Student/Bedlam Festival (Festival). All financial details of an Annual Event must be passed by the Business Manager prior to proposing.

3.4 An Extraordinary show is any production/event, which could not reasonably meet the above criteria. This is to be decided by the Committee. It can be any kind of production which does not fall into a festival/annual event category. If any member objects to the ruling of the Committee, a vote is conducted against the Committee’s ruling. Any proposal for an Extraordinary show that clashes with another EUTC show or event is declared void; this includes allocated show slots. The production team of the affected show or event may choose to waive this right. All Extraordinary proposals wishing to be proposed at a scheduled GM must be submitted to the Committee no later than the Committee Meeting prior to the GM show proposal deadline (i.e. two Committee Meetings prior to the GM) and the relating proposal forms should be submitted no later than the given show deadline. For all Extraordinary proposals falling outside of a scheduled GM, an EGM will be called. The show budget should have been passed by the Business Manager before approaching the Committee. There will be no limit to how many Extraordinaries can take place in a term and this will not be a consideration upon deciding whether or not a proposal is an Extraordinary or not. Any Extraordinary taking place outside of the building will not get stage space for rehearsing unless it is going free or a request is made, in which case it is at the Secretary’s discretion.

3.5 The number of slots having been decided at a Committee Meeting, a preference system (see clause 8.0 below) incorporating each show on its merits shall be used on all proposals submitted before the advertised deadline. In order of preference, accepted shows shall choose their preferred slot from those available. If unfilled slots remain, the preference system shall be used on any shows deemed late and the remaining slots allocated in order of preference. Shows may swap slots by mutual consent at this stage, or withdraw their proposal.

3.6 If a slot falls vacant for any reason, or circumstances substantially alter the performance conditions of a slot, the Committee may reopen the slot selection procedure, strictly on the order of the original preference vote, ignoring any shows that no longer require a slot. Their decision for or against may be reversed by the passing of a motion at a meeting of the Company.

3.7 Any production team wishing to apply to NSDF with their show must follow the NSDF Guidelines, which can be found on our website.

4.0 Production Guidelines

4.1 All shows shall follow the Production Guidelines at all times. All members of the production team are jointly and severally liable for any failure to comply in this matter.

4.2 The Productions Manager shall be responsible for creating and distributing the Production Guidelines, following advice from the Committee. They must use best endeavours to do so.

4.3 The Productions Manager shall ensure these are up to date prior to a General Meeting of the Company. A set of Production Guidelines must be ratified at a General Meeting of the Company at least once a year.

4.4 Producers are responsible for obtaining the Guidelines and briefing their team. They shall use best endeavours to do so.

4.5 The Chair may temporarily suspend an article of the Production Guidelines if they believe it is in the best interests of the EUTC to do so. The suspension must be of fixed duration and cannot in any case extend beyond the next General Meeting of the company.

5.0 Fringe

5.1 The Fringe Venue Manager shall decide the number of slots available to EUTC productions prior to the AGM. The Fringe Venue Manager must allocate at least one slot to the EUTC.

5.2 A preference system (see clause 8.0 below) shall be used to select EUTC Fringe productions under all circumstances, following the passing of a production merit vote.

5.3 The EUTC President, outgoing Fringe Venue Manager and EUSA representatives will interview the Fringe Venue Manager. In the event of conflicts of interest the remaining members of this panel may select a replacement member.

5.4 The EUTC President, Fringe Venue Manager and EUSA representatives, together with others as deemed appropriate by this group, will interview for the other three Fringe positions, in the event of a conflict of interest see 5.3.

5.5 The EUSA office bearer shall have the right to refer a decision made by the panel to the EUSA Finance Committee only if they feel the interview was not conducted fairly.

6.0 Festivals

6.1 Any member may propose a Festival to be organised by the EUTC. This must be done at a General Meeting and be submitted one week prior to that meeting. Such a Festival must be budgeted to cover all expenses. Voting will operate as per section 8 below.

6.2 The proposal of a Festival must include a named Administrator who is responsible for the running of that Festival and creating a sub-committee of: a Marketing Manager, a Theatre Manager for each venue, a Technical Manager, a Box Office Manager and a Café Manager (if there is to be a box office or café respectively). All persons filling these positions must be members and they must be ratified at a Company Meeting unless they are already part of the festival team by the proposal submission deadline, in which case they shall be considered ratified if the proposal is successful. Any member of the company may propose a motion to ratify a festival team member at a Company Meeting if they have solid reasons to do so.

7.0 Procedure

7.1 The proposers of all shows and all persons standing for election have the right to a short speech (duration to be specified by the Chair), followed by questions as directed by the Chair.

8.0 Voting

A Single Transferable Vote, or STV, shall be used in all cases where a preference vote is required. The voting and counting procedure is detailed below. For simplicity, ‘candidate’ shall refer to any person, show or proposal standing in an election. In any preference vote a decision against all candidates is valid and shall be indicated by the words ‘none’ or ‘no-one’, as appropriate. In any vote where only one candidate stands, a STV may be performed between the candidate and ‘none’ or ‘no-one’. This is equivalent to a simple YES/NO/ABSTAIN majority vote, where ABSTAIN is neither a YES, nor a NO, and will only be counted towards ensuring that quorum is met.

8.0.1 A Single Transferable Vote, or STV, shall be used in all cases where a preference vote is required. Before a GM or any other meeting when preference votes may be required begins, a computer will be set up in the boxofﬁce (or elsewhere) and a program will be created with the formula already set up. When votes need to be counted two members of the company, whom do not have conﬂict of interest in the matter being voted up, will count the votes and enter the information into the spread sheet. The code for the formula calculating the votes will be available to be seen by any member of the company on request to the creator.

8.0.2 A quota is calculated using the Droop quota formula. This quota is the minimum number of votes a candidate requires to secure a winning place. The formula is: Quota = V/(P+1) + 1 where: V = Total number of valid votes. (Spoiled ballots to be recorded separately.) P = Number of winning places available. (e.g. For a committee position P=1, for show proposals P = number of available slots.) The result should always be rounded down to the nearest integer (e.g. 17.667 should become 17).

8.0.3 First preference votes are counted. If a candidate has equalled or passed the quota then they are declared elected and their surplus votes are redistributed as described below (section 8.0.4). If no candidate has reached the quota then the ballots from the candidate with the lowest number of votes are redistributed amongst the remaining candidates; the votes are transferred at their current value, according to the next highest preference on the ballot, and thus a candidate is removed from the election. Repeat this process until all winning places have been filled or until as many candidates remain as there are winning places.

8.0.4 Redistributing surplus votes: Surplus votes are those a candidate receives above the quota (e.g. candidate’s total votes – quota). The surplus votes are redistributed according to the ratio of next highest preferences from the candidate’s total votes. In the case of the next highest preference being either already elected or eliminated, the subsequent preference should be used. If no further preferences have been cast then the ballot becomes non-transferable and should be recorded as such, at it’s current value.

The redistributed votes each candidate receives are calculated using the following formula: Redistributed votes for candidate B = (s/t) x n where:

s = Number of surplus votes. t = Total number of votes for candidate being redistributed. n = Number of next preference votes for candidate B.

(e.g. Assume the quota is 20 and candidate A has 24 votes. If the next preference is for candidate B on 12 of those ballots, and for candidate C on the other 12, then the 4 surplus votes may be split evenly between B and C. Alternatively, if the next preference is B for 3, C for 15 and 6 are unspecified then B gets 0.5 additional votes, C gets 2.5 and 1 vote is not re-allocated and recorded as non-transferable.)

8.0.5 The order of preference shall be decided by the order in which the candidates reach the quota; if there comes a point when there are as many candidates as winning places, they shall be ranked according to their total votes received. In the event of a tie between two or more candidates, the Chair will hold the casting vote.

8.1 The Chair shall signal that a vote is to be taken and whether it is to be by secret ballot or show of hands.

8.2 Any member may request a secret ballot. If they do so a secret ballot must be carried out.

8.3 If the motion is to be decided by show of hands, the members directly affected by the motion must leave the room.

8.4 The Chair shall appoint two vote takers from the members present, who are not directly involved in the motion under debate.

8.5 These vote-takers shall count the number of votes and inform the Chair of the result.

8.6 If available and practical, an electronic voting system may be used instead of paper for secret ballots.

8.6.1 The system must comply with other regulations.

8.6.2 The system may be commercially acquired, or developed by another party. In the former case, the product’s name must be disclosed to the company. In the latter case, any relevant source code must be open sourced.

8.7 In the event of there being an obvious majority in favour, the Chair may declare the motion to be ‘passed by acclaim’. Any member present may challenge this decision, at which point the votes will be counted as normal.

8.8 In the event of a secret ballot any member who wishes may observe the count.

8.9 Voting is by simple majority in Committee Meetings. Votes on production merit, proposed motions and amendments to the Constitution or Standing Orders require a 2/3 majority in favour, using a YES/NO/ABSTAIN ballot. In the case of show selection, appointment to posts or any vote that requires a preference system, the method of voting described in clause 8.0 shall be used. In all other cases (unless indicated otherwise herein) votes require a 2/3 majority. Spoiled ballots shall be discounted from all votes, before counting begins, and recorded separately. Abstains will be counted towards reaching quorum, but will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.

8.10 A re-vote may be called if behaviour contravening the Constitution or Standing Orders has taken place before or during the vote.
